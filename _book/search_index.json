About the Malaysian Student Association at UIUC What is this book?", " A Pre-Arrival Guide For Incoming &amp; Prospective Students By the Student Outreach Committee of MaSA UIUC Introduction Mobile users: use the burger icon at the top-left to navigate! This book aims primarily as a general guideline for students who have accepted their admission into the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC for short). Secondarily, were also working on detailing life at the university as Malaysians in this book for those who are interested in the university, but do not know much. This book is still heavily a work in progress, so were prioritizing writing the pre-arrival sections! A printable version of this book is being worked on. In the meantime, this older Google Doc that we have based this site on should have sufficient information to be still usable offline. Need to Contact a Malaysian Student? Email us at masauiuc@gmail.com! We understand that you may have more personal or specific problems that youd like more information on. Whether its about sponsored students, the environment, students experience with certain courses, or you just want to talk to someone from UIUC, hit us up at that email! About the Malaysian Student Association at UIUC MaSA for short. Were a relatively small Registered Student Organization, or an RSO, which is what we call clubs and societies here (find more here!). We primarily aim to enrich the living experience in UIUC for Malaysians in Urbana-Champaign, whether they be students or residents, and we also aim to spread cultural awareness of Malaysia in the campus from time to time. We host events as frequently as every week, where Malaysians get together to hang out, play, chat, and eat! Our events range from larger thematic ones like our Mid-Autumn Festival, Deepavali, and Chinese New Year celebration events, to smaller ones like weekly boardgame nights and cookouts. We only request a $15 fee every semester, and in return we grant you access to all events we host, almost all of which come with good free food; trust us, we make it very worthwhile. Have a question for us? Heres the email link again!

"],["pre-departure-preparations.html", "Chapter 1 Pre-departure Preparations 1.1 Documents 1.2 Money 1.3 Contacts 1.4 Packing", " Chapter 1 Pre-departure Preparations Most if not all of this information is derived from the MASA Newcomers Information Pack 2021, created by the former Head of Student Outreach Aidi Wafi. For all intents and purposes, this section is a copy-paste of that, with little to no significant changes besides formatting and language. 1.1 Documents Be sure to print out whatever you need a copy of. It will be difficult printing anything without current students help until you get your i-Card here in the university. You wont have WiFi/5G either. Put all your documents in one file, order them well, and bring it in your hand luggage. COVID-Era Documents A PCR Test Result (preferrably negative, must be taken 3 days prior to flight) Travel Documents Passport Visa Boarding pass(es) University documents I-20 Offer letter &amp; financial statement McKinley Health Center forms, immunization history &amp; medical check-up results 1.2 Money Always have your money on your person. Hand luggage works too but is possibly riskier. Most international airports accept major currencies. If you plan to exchange foreign currencies, we recommend you do it in Malaysia beforehand. You could also change them at international airports (like OHare, which youd likely arrive or transition at). You wont get to change foreign currencies to USD in Urbana-Champaign. 1.3 Contacts Be sure to have with you / remember emergency contact number(s) to call when you reach the U.S. in case anything happens. If youd like to have someone to contact here in UIUC, email us and well help you. 1.4 Packing We split these into two parts: Things you may likely bring on-hand, and things you may prefer to bring in your check-in luggage. 1.4.1 On-Hand Luggage Heres what we can tell you if you plan to bring any of these with you: Laptops, iPads, personal computers in general If youre carrying them on you, make sure theyre easily accessible. Youll have to take them out at security checks a lot of times. Chargers Get an international adapter! The plugs in the US are very much not like our UK-standard ones in Malaysia. Alternatively, you could buy new cables for your chargers when you get here. Some of us do that, some of us use our adapter till we leave. US Plugs by electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk Toiletries kit for travel Hygiene is important. Having small toiletry bag on you is a good idea if you want to keep fresh between flights. You could bring a toothbrush, toothpaste tub, face towel, mouthwash, lotion, etc. All hygiene goods must be within travel-size: Check this with your airlines website. If any of these are liquids, put them in a ziploc bag so that its easy to take them out during security checks. Jackets or sweaters It can get pretty cold in the plane. Its a good idea to have one on you once youre out of Malaysia. Something to keep you occupied Flights to the US tend to be looong. If the on-flight movies dont cut it for you, you may want to have something with you to keep busy. Well-charged handheld gaming consoles A good book The Good Books (religious texts) Anything else you may come up with Clothes If you have the space, some extra clothes might be a good idea, especially under the rare unfortunate chance your luggage doesnt arrive on time. 1.4.2 Check-in Luggage 1.4.2.1 Clothes Everyday clothes Shirts, pants, undergarments, socks, shoes, and all Remember that you can always buy more of anything once you arrive here! Overall, how much is enough to bring is up to you and your expected living conditions here Jackets, sweaters A few extra would be good besides the one you bring on-hand As for winter clothes, MaSA has yearly trips to Chicago and a shopping outlet near there to buy winter clothes. We do this after new students arrive, so if you dont have winter clothing or dont want to bring them from home, this is an option Traditional clothes MaSA does celebrate traditional Malaysian events, so bring your traditional clothes if you want to keep in theme! One towel Keep it small and thin, you dont want it taking too much space. You can get a new one when you arrive, but in the meantime, better to have one than none 1.4.2.2 Other Items Were putting miscellaneous things first because its shorter than the food section, hahh. For Muslims Having a prayer mat is a good idea You cant buy kain pelikat here, so bring one if you feel like youd at least sometimes need it Scarves &amp; brooches are somewhat difficult to buy here besides online; shawls are available here, but are somewhat costly Keepsakes Plushies, precious gifts, bantal busuk, photos you know it! Medicine Inhalers &amp; supplements come to mind (fish oil, vitamins, etc) We recommend medicines for flu, fever, coughs, pain, sore throats, headaches, etc Any pharmacy goods youve found useful will continue to be great when youre here. Be sure to declare all medical goods! Spare glasses / contact lenses A very very very very good idea. Get everything you can from Malaysia. Glasses are relatively more expensive in the US. Bring your glasses prescription here too so you dont have to pay out if you do have to get a check-up. As for contact lenses: Solutions are cheaper in Malaysia, but you dont have to bring too much (three 350 mL bottles are good enough). A typical 300 ml bottle costs around $10 if were not mistaken. Stationery You can always get your stock here. Below, we detail the differences between Malaysian stationery and US stationery. Punchers The United States uses Letter size paper. Malaysian punchers are for A4, so just dont bring one. Get one here. Pens, pencils &amp; erasers You can totally buy them in the US. If you bring mechanical pencils from Malaysia, theres no guarantee that the lead refills are identical to ours. Rulers If you really want to avoid metric, a centimeter ruler from home wouldnt be a bad idea. The Union Bookstore does sell rulers with inch and centimeter measures though. Correction tape You honestly dont need this. You wouldnt have the time to use it when note-taking, nor in exams. Plus, most assignments are done online now. 1.4.2.3 Food DECLARE ALL FOOD YOU BRING. Whatever food you bring, double-check with airport guidelines to make sure theyre actually allowed to bring. To make it easier in security checks, if your food is not packaged, list its ingredients. If youre living in a campus residential hall, you may want more instant food, snacks, and anything that doesnt require cooking. That being said, the dining halls are almost sure to keep you full, and you can also get snacks pretty easily in most freshman halls! The following list refers to more valuable foodstuffs that you cant easily get here, so youd probably want to bring more of them as a stockpile. These mostly refer to ingredients, so these apply less to those initially living in residence halls. [Check this section to know what you can get here.][Groceries] Kuih Raya If you havent finished them all, anyways! If you really want to maximize how much kuih you bring, coordinate with your friends! Then you can make sure everyones bringing a different variety of goods. You are going to be travelling a good amount, so its best not to bring any kuih thats too fragile nanti you sampai UIUC bukak bukak kuih semperit pecah pecah, hancur hati Instant paste or Bouillon cubes Its somewhat difficult or pricey to get halal stock cubes and curry spices here. Adabi curry spices (like curry or kurma) Maggi instant cubes Instant drinks, tea bags, etc Milo, Horlicks, Lipton tea, Vico, etc. 1kg is typically enough, unless you drink a lot. Serunding ayam / serunding ikan bilis BEEF PRODUCTS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN CUSTOMS. Do not try to bring them. People have been brought to court for this. Chicken and fish is absolutely fine, theyre great to go with extra rice! Dried anchovies / ikan bilis Theyre expensive here. Really. If you plan to cook recipes that use them, definitely consider bringing dried anchovies from home. Brahim products (not as necessarry) Belacan Tomyam paste, kerisik (fried coconut shavings), instant powders, curry powders You can get them here, but they likely wont taste similar to what we get in Malaysia. "],["arrival.html", "Chapter 2 Arrival 2.1 Getting tested for COVID 2.2 Getting your Student ID 2.3 Getting a Bank Account (PNC) 2.4 Getting a Data Plan", " Chapter 2 Arrival Note: typically, the Membership Director(s) of MaSA will assist incoming students with this entire process. Still, well detail out everything that should be done by an incoming student when here, for the sake of coverage and if it so happens that we for whatever rare reason are unable to assist. 2.1 Getting tested for COVID The university facilitates COVID-testing for free for faculty &amp; students. The Illinois App will show you the nearest testing facility to you. They usually scan you in with your I-Card, but if you dont have that yet, you can tell them your UIN instead1. Your results will usually return later in the day on your McKinley app. Youll get an email for it on your @illinois.edu inbox as well. 2.2 Getting your Student ID Youll have to make your way to the Illini Union Bookstore for your I-Card. There should be someone at the desk whom you may ask directions for. Just say you want to get your I-Card. The I-Card is necessary for gaining access to the residence hall you live in, for entering certain campus buildings, and scanning in for things like COVID tests or McKinley appointments. It also acts as an ATM card, if you bind your PNC bank account to it! Just in case, check here for their opening times. 2.3 Getting a Bank Account (PNC) Luckily, this is also at the Illini Union Bookstore! Again, front desk can direct you if the location isnt so obvious on arrival. Youll be talking to someone in the PNC branch and theyll be helping you through the process of getting your account and debit card settled up. SEVERAL WARNINGS: You do not get your debit card immediately; rather, it will be mailed to the address you registered yourself under, three days later. Also, a phone number needs to be filled in during that process. Typically, since MaSA board members will be there with you, incoming students will use one of our phone numbers for the time being. As far as we can tell, this has been inconsequential. If you cannot have a MaSA member assisting you, then you may have to clear getting a data plan &amp; phone number first. 2.4 Getting a Data Plan A phone number is very very important for getting around. So is mobile internet. You should check if your phone supports mobile plans here; this tends not to be the case for Android-phone users, so you may have to purchase a new phone here. Plans are relatively cheap here, even at unlimited data, so we usually recommend getting unlimited data unless you want to cheap out and know you arent going to use much every month. The nature of this process is such that people tend to research their dataplan options once, stick to one dataplan, then never think about it ever again. Or, someone else did it for you and included you in the family plan for cheaper plans. The latter is the case for me, the writer, so Im unable to describe this section in too much detail, but heres some of the dataplans I recommend, and why I recommend them: Mint This in our experience has been the best, least-hassle, touchdown option for incoming students. You can order a simcard online for whatever duration you choose and theyll mail it to you, with an eject pin too You can ask a MaSA board member to make this purchase for you (and you pay them back later) if you want it ASAP, since ordering online means requiring a debit/credit card (which comically requires a phone number). Cricket This is what I use. Unlimited data for $20 a month for a family of 4 or more. Other Im aware of the existence of T-Mobile &amp; Verizon here as well. Im not sure what their processes are, nor their rates. A 9-digit number associated to you as a student. It should be on one of your university documents.
