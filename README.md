This repository contains most of the files made to write [this book!](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/f9a4a516-a67e-4e06-a490-a236a8ce2ce1/access/2426)

Wait wait wait wait, someone's actually visited this repo? I haven't even finished the readme yet...!

Well, hello! If you're here (and not me), you're probably here because you wanted to raise an issue about a typo or a suggestion about this book's content. Or, you really just like clicking links, that's valid too.

If you want to get some `git` practice in, you may even wish to fork this repository, make the corrections yourself, and make a pull request to me! You will be credited accordingly.
